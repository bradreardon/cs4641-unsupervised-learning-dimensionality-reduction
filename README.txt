CS 4641: Supervised Learning
Author: Bradley Reardon

Code

    Code can be found at https://github.com/bradreardon/cs4641-supervised-learning.

Requirements

    - Only tested with Python 3.7+ (though lower in-support versions of Python 3 may be sufficient)
    - Packages specified in `requirements.txt`:
        - Install with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

    Before running, make sure that the `out` directory exists in the same place as `main.py` has the following
    structure:

    ```
    out
    |- boosting
    |- decision_tree_pruning
    |- knn
    |- neural_net
    |- svm
    ```

    This can be done with the command `mkdir -p out/{boosting,decision_tree_pruning,knn,neural_net,svm}`.

Running

    `main.py` provides usage instructions. In general, commands follow the format `python main.py <algorithm>`.

    For some algorithms, parameters may be specified on the CLI, though some of these cases are unimplemented.

    Running each script will output statistics (and warnings!) for the training of the algorithm, and will export charts
    to subdirectories of the `out` directory.

Attribution

    scikit-learn provided excellent documentation, and some of the charts generated by this program can be found in the
    scikit-learn documentation. Namely, the boosting error chart was modified from the documentation online.
